README.txt for LOCKSSdm 
=======================

LOCKSSdm allows collections managed in CONTENTdm (http://contentdm.org/)
to be preserved in LOCKSS (http://www.lockss.org/) and made accessible 
to end users. Normally, to preserve content in LOCKSS your library needs
to be a member of a Private LOCKSS Network. Please contact LOCKSS
(http://www.lockss.org/contact-us/) to find out more about Private LOCKSS
Networks.

LOCKSSdm has two parts: 1) a CONTENTdm 6.1 (or higher) plugin and 2) a proxy
script. You install the CONTENTdm plugin using your CONTENTdm server's website
configuration tool, and you install the proxy script on a separate web
server. Detailed instructions on installing both are provided in the 
README.txt files in the 'contentdm' and 'proxy' subdirectories in this
package.
